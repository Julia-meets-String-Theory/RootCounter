# RootCounter

Originally, this code was and currently still is available in the [ToricVarieties_project](https://github.com/homalg-project/ToricVarieties_project). To make this tool available to other computer algebra systems, the code has been moved to this repository at the beginning of 2023. For more background, see e.g. [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00008.pdf) and references therein.
